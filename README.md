# no-lazy-load

**no lazy load** plugin by **Tension Extension**

BSD 2-clause based on the current [Firefox add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nolazyload/)

I could not find a public repository, so here it is.  With changes.  I like it because it's simple.  It could be a GreaseMonkey / TamperMonkey user script for Chrome as well.

If you use [Download All Images](https://webextension.org/listing/save-images.html) it will get all of the data-srcset images.  Letting **no-lazy-load** pre-process the page results in a single, optimal image.
