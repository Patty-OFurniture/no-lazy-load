# no-lazy-load

**no lazy load** plugin by **Tension Extension**

BSD 2-clause based on the current [Firefox add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nolazyload/)

I could not find a public repository, so here it is.  With changes.  

I like it because it's simple.  It could be a GreaseMonkey / TamperMonkey user script for Chrome as well.
